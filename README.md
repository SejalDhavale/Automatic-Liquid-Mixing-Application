In many industries, there are lots of mixing system used for solutions mixing. Some plants use complete automation or semi-automation.

In a manual system, there are so many disadvantages such as lack of Accuracy,Time delay problems, loss of liquids, Time consumption, etc.

In this application pure unmixed solution can be prepared by the operator using switches S1 and S2. And mixed solution or material can be prepared by the operator using switch S3.
Operator observes the level of the tank and he can discharge the liquid inside tank by operating valve V5.
Also the agitator motor M will be in running while tank is being filled. We will provide interlock system so operator cannot operate both switches at same time.

V1, V3 and V5 are manual valves which is not connected to the PLC.

V2 and V4 are electronically operated valves which can be controlled by PLC.
